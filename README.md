- Supabase account (free tier works)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jessicawestbrook/skilltree.git
   cd skilltree
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # Supabase Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
   
   # Email Service Configuration (Resend)
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
   
   # Application Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
   
   # Optional: Error Tracking (Sentry)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN=your_sentry_dsn_here
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT=development
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_RELEASE=1.0.0
   
   # Optional: PWA Configuration
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PWA_ENABLED=true
   ```

4. **Set up the database**
   
   Run these SQL scripts in your Supabase SQL editor in order:
   
   ```sql
   -- Run each script in the Supabase SQL editor:
   scripts/create-social-tables.sql   # Creates all social feature tables (friends, groups, activity feed)
   
   -- Or run individual migration scripts:
   00-prepare-for-migration.sql      # Disables RLS for migration
   01-create-core-tables.sql          # Core tables
   02-create-dependent-tables.sql     # Dependent tables
   03-create-user-tables.sql          # User profile tables
   04-create-views-and-functions.sql  # Views and triggers
   ```
   
   **Important**: The `create-social-tables.sql` script creates all necessary tables for social features including:
   - Friends and friend requests tables
   - User profiles table
   - Study groups and members tables
   - Activity feed table
   - Friend suggestions function
   - All necessary RLS policies

5. **Migrate the data**
   ```bash
   npm run migrate:all

   - 50+ prerequisite relationships
   - 7 learning paths
   - Quiz questions for various topics

6. **Re-enable security**
   ```sql
   -- Run in Supabase SQL editor:
   05-enable-security.sql
   ```

7. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.
